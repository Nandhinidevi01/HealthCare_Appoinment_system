          Choose appointment dates/times

          Submit a basic form to book an appointment

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**

    Navigation bar (links to Home, Book Appointment, About, Contact)

    Banner image or hero section

3. Doctor List Page (doctors.html)

    List of available doctors in a table or card layout

    Each card/table row can show:

    Availability

    Contact

4. Contact Page (contact.html)

**Summary:**

This project focuses on creating a clean, user-friendly interface for a healthcare appointment system using only HTML and CSS. It doesn’t include backend/database functionality but can be extended later using JavaScript, PHP, or a database like MySQL.
